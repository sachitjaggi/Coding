*************************TYPE OF PROBLEMS***************************

1=>SHORTEST PATH PROBlEM
    UNWEIGHTED - BFS
    WEIGHTED-Dijkstra,Bellman Ford,Floyd Warshal,A*

2=> Connectivity
 *USE a union find datastructure 
 *use a search algorithm (DFS,BFS)

3=>Negative Cycles
 BELLMAN FORD AND FLOYD Warshal

4=>STRONGLY Connected compenents


5=>Travelling Salesman PROBlEM

6=>Bridges /Articulation pts
Bridges are edges whose removal incresaes the number of connected compenents of a graph
Articulation pts are pts whose removal incresaes the number of connected compenents of a graph

7=>Minimum Spanning tree
Kruskal prim 

8=> Network Flow

**********DFS**********
Count connected Components
Determine Connectivity
Bridges or articulation point
