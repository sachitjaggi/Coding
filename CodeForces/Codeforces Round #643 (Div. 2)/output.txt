Sir,
I had applied for Microsoft during the on-campus internship season.Even though I was well prepared ,I was not able to qualify the coding round itself due to some reasons. 
I was told that the cooldown period is applicable only if you have qualified for interviews.Therefore I wanted to Microsoft offcampus .If I am  eligible for applying I  request you to kindly refer me for the role of an intern.

Thank You
